Trading Thoughts: Midweek Market Vibes
Woke up with the markets on my mind (as usual). Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™m seeing, thinking, and doing this week:

ðŸ”¹ Crypto â€“ Weâ€™re in a weird in-between. BTC hovering around key support zones. Watching for a decisive move. Still DCAâ€™ing into a few alt positions (ETH, SOL, and a sneaky layer-2 project Iâ€™ve been loving ). Not going all in, but I'm setting alerts and staying nimble.

ðŸ”¹ Equities â€“ Tech stocks are flirting with overbought zones. NVDA and TSLA still on my radar. I trimmed some of my AI-related holdings last week, locking in gains and holding cash for re-entry. Waiting for pullbacks before I stack again.

ðŸ”¹ Macro â€“ Inflation talk still heavy. Fed isnâ€™t done yet. Cash is a position, friends. I'm keeping some dry powder on the side just in case we get a market tantrum.

ðŸ”¹ Strategy This Week â€“

Light trades.

Protect capital.

Focus on quality over quantity.

Remember: Boring consistency > wild swings.

Also:
Spent the morning journaling my trades. Itâ€™s wild how writing things down keeps you grounded.
Currently trading from my kitchen counter with Max (my dog) by my side and a double espresso in hand. Lifeâ€™s about balance. Work smart, not just hard.

Remember: You donâ€™t have to chase every wave. Let some pass. The oceanâ€™s always got another one coming.
